- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Arearda. For the last four years, I've been working in the healthcare industry. With the onset of the pandemic, I wanted to expand my skills, get out of that industry, and into something I have always enjoyed: tech. Iâ€™ve wanted to make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives and feel that gaining a better understanding of the various technologies we use on a daily basis would be my best option. It took courage, hard work, and resilience, but I knew in order to change my life, I had to change myself.  Today, I am proud to call myself a Software Engineer and look forward to the positive impacts I can make in the world of tech.
